# Scanner

This script will take in input and then run a port scan against the hosts and ports that were listed. It has a couple of new functions such as generating an output file that will timestamp and list the output. This allows for more automation after the scan is complete. 

You are able to pass a url and have the output file post to that url. 

You are able to choose between TCP or UDP

There are many more things, but run the -h or --help command to see a full list of the posibilities.
